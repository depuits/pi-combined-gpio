# pi-combined-gpio
Raspberry pi project combining gpio project to run in a single instance. Simply combines multiple projects which use the [pigpio](https://github.com/fivdi/pigpio) library into a single application. This because of the [pigpio limitation](https://github.com/fivdi/pigpio#limitations) to only be able to be used by a single process.
